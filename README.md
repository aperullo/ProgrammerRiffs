# ProgrammerRiffs
A collection of my favorite programming joke formats. Feel free to contribute more as pull requests.

## Structure
Each of the various subfolders is based around a single format for a joke, but with different content based on the programming language/tech thing being made fun of.

### Examples

#### **Two Problems** - Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, 
- *"I know, I’ll use Regular Expressions."* Now they have two problems.
- *"I know, I’ll use Java."* Now they have a ProblemFactory.

As with any meme or exploitable it can be hard to track down the originator of every variant. I've done my best to keep track of the places I found these on in their respective folders.
